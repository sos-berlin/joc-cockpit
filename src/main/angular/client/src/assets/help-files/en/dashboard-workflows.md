## Workflow Status

Workflows are displayed from the following status:

- **Synchronized** Workflows are deployed and are available with the Controller and Agents.
- **Not Synchronized** Workflows are not deployed to Controller and Agents but are available from the inventory only.
- **Suspended** Workflows are frozen, they accept Orders but will not allow Orders starting until Workflows will be resumed.
- **Outstanding** Workflows wait for confirmation by one or more Agents that the Workflow is suspended.

Clicking the indicated number of Workflows navigates to the *Workflows* view that displays Workflows using the related filter.
