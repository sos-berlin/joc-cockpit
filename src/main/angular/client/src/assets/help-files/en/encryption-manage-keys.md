# Manage Encryption Keys

The [JS7 - Encryption and Decryption](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Encryption+and+Decryption) offers a secure way of handling secrets used in Jobs. Users can encrypt and decrypt sensitive data such as passwords by use of asymmetric keys.

Encryption and decryption make use of asymmetric X.509 Private Keys and Certificates. This includes the following roles:

- Sender: has access to the receiver's Certificate or Public Key and encrypts a secret based on the receiver's Public Key that is directly available or that can be calculated from a Certificate.
- Receiver: has access to the Private Key that allows decryption of the encrypted secret.

For creation of Encryption Keys see [JS7 - How to create X.509 Encryption Keys](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+How+to+create+X.509+Encryption+Keys).

For management of Encryption Keys see [JS7 - Encryption - Management of Encryption Keys](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Encryption+-+Management+of+Encryption+Keys).

The process of encryption works like this:

The process of decryption works like this:

The *Manage Encryption Keys* page is used for managing Certificates and specifying properties of the Certificate.
