# Approver Profiles

The [JS7 - Approval Process](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Approval+Process) is offered for situations in which users intend performing operations such as adding or cancelling Orders that require approval by a second user. This can include any operation that modifies a scheduling object.

The Approval Process involves the following roles:

- A *Requestor* requests performing an intervention that requires approval.
- An *Approver* confirms or denies the Approval Request.

The basic functionality of the Approval Process includes:

- to implement the 4-eyes principle: an *Approver* must confirm the intervention of a *Requestor* before the intervention can be executed in the scope of the *Requestor's* account, roles and permissions. 
- to keep track of pending Approval Requests.
- to offer fallback to a number of *Approvers*.
