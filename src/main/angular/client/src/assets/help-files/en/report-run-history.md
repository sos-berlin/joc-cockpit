# Report Run History

- Reports are created from predefined [Report Templates](/report-templates) that are parameterized from [Configuration - Inventory - Reports](/configuration-inventory-reports).
- Users run Reports from the [Report Creation](/report-creation) view or by [JS7 - Reports - Automation](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Reports+-+Automation). The  *Report Run History* view  provides evidence about past Report runs.
