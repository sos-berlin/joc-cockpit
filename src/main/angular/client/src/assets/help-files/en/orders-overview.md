- **Download Icon**: clicking the icon will download the Order's log to a file.

By default display of Order logs is limited to 10MB log size and otherwise logs are downloaded to files. Users can adjust the limit from the [Settings - JOC Cockpit](/settings-joc) page.

## Operations

### Operations on Orders

Users find an action menu per Order that offers operations available for the given Order state.

For Orders in the *pending*, *scheduled*, *in progress*, *running*, *suspended*, *prompting*, *waiting*, *failed* state the following operations are offered:

- **Modify Priority** 
  - If an Order will meet a *Resource Lock* instruction in the Workflow that limits parallelism, then its *Priority* determines the position in the queue of *waiting* Orders.
  - *Priorities* are specified from negative, zero and positive integers or from the shortcuts offered. A higher *Priority* has precedence. Shortcuts offer the following values:
    - **Low**: -20000
    - **Below Normal**: -10000
    - **Normal**: 0
    - **Above Normal**: 10000
    - **High**: 20000
- **Cancel** will terminate the Order. Running Orders will complete the current Job or Workflow Instruction and will leave the Workflow with a failed history status.
- **Cancel/terminate task** will forcibly terminate Orders running a Job. Orders will leave the Workflow with a failed history status.
- **Cancel/reset** will forcibly terminate Orders running a Job. Orders will leave the Workflow with a failed history status.
- **Suspend** will suspend the Order. Running Orders will be suspended after they completed the current Job or Workflow Instruction.
- **Suspend/terminate task** will forcibly terminate running Orders and will suspend the Orders.
- **Suspend/reset** will immediately reset the current Workflow Instruction and will put the Order to the *suspended* state. The option can be combined with forcibly terminating tasks for *running* Orders.
- **Resume** will continue a *suspended* or *failed* resumable Order.

For Orders holding the *completed* state and for disrupted Orders in the *failed* state the following operations are offered:

- **Leave Workflow** will terminate the Order. 
  - *Completed* Orders will leave the Workflow with a *successful* history status.
  - *Failed/disrupted* Orders will leave the Workflow with a *failed* history status.

Additional operations can be available that are specific for the Order state.

### Bulk Operations

Bulk operations are available when selecting Orders from related checkboxes. They offer the same operations as for individual Orders.

When selecting Orders, then related buttons for bulk operations become visible in the upper part of the screen holding captions similar to the above explained operations.

## Filters

User's can apply filters to limit display of Orders. Filter buttons are available at top of the window.

### Date Range Filter Button

The dropdown button offers selecting Orders from a date range:

- **All** specifies Orders scheduled for any past and future date being displayed.
- **Today** Orders are related to the current day which is calculated from the time zone in the [Profile - Preferences](/profile-preferences).
- **Next hour** includes Orders that should start within the next hour.
- **Next 12 hours** includes Orders that should start within the next 12 hours.
- **Next 24 hours** includes Orders that should start within the next 24 hours.
- **Next day** includes Orders that should start until end of the next day.
- **Next 7 days** includes Orders that should start within the next 7 days.

### State Filter Buttons

Similar to the *Order State Selection Panel* a filter button is available per Order state to filter display of Orders.

### From .. To Date Input Filter

For Orders in the *in progress*, *running*, *failed*, *completed* state input fields are available to specify the date and time for which an Order holds the related state.

Users can specify absolute or relative dates and times.

### Results Filter

The filter limits display to matching *Order IDs* and *Workflow Names*. The filter is applied to visible Orders and works case-insensitive.
