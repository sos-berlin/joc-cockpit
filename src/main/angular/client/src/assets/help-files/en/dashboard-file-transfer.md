## File Transfer History

The history summary counts successful and failed transfers.

- **Successful** transfers include successful jobs and failed jobs that recovered for example by retrying.
- **Failed** transfers indicate jobs that failed permanently.

Clicking the indicated number navigates to the *File Transfer History* view that displays transfers in detail.

## Filters

The drop-down button in the upper-right corner of the panel offers selecting past transfer jobs from a date range:

- **Today** Jobs are related to the current day which is calculated from the time zone in the user's profile.
- **Last Hour** includes Jobs that completed during the last hour.
- **Last 12 Hours** includes Jobs that completed during the last 12 hours.
- **Last 24 Hours** includes Jobs that completed during the last 24 hours.
