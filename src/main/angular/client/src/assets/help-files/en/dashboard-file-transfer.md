# File Transfer

The *File Transfer* panel provides the summary of past transfers using the YADE Managed File Transfer.

## File Transfer History

The history summary counts successful and failed transfers.

- **Successful** transfers include successful jobs and failed jobs that recovered for example by retrying.

Clicking the indicated number navigates to the *File Transfer History* view that displays transfers in detail.

- **Today** Jobs are related to the current day which is calculated from the time zone in the user's profile.

- **Last 12 Hours** includes Jobs that completed during the last 12 hours.
