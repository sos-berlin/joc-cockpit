# Report Creation

The [JS7 - Reports](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Reports) offer insight from past execution of Workflows and Jobs:

- Reports are created from predefined [Report Templates](/report-templates) that are parameterized from [Configuration - Inventory - Reports](/configuration-inventory-reports).
- Users run Reports from the *Report Creation* view or by [JS7 - Reports - Automation](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Reports+-+Automation). The  [Report - Run History](/report-run-history) view provides evidence about past Report runs.
- Reports are visualized in the [Reports](/reports) view.

## Display of Report Configurations

Reports are configured with the [Configuration - Inventory - Reports](/configuration-inventory-reports) view.

Reports Configurations are available 

- from the *Folder Panel* that offers navigation to Report Configurations.
- from the *Report Configuration Panel* that shows details of the selected Report Configuration.

### Folder Panel

The panel offers navigation through inventory folders that hold Report Configurations:

- Selecting a folder displays available Report Configurations in the *Report Configuration Panel*.
- Clicking the *chevron-down* icon for a given folder will display Report Configurations in the current folder and sub-folders recursively.
- Clicking the *chevron-up* icon will collapse the current folder.

### Report Configuration Panel

The panel displays Report Configurations available from the currently selected folder. Report Configurations are displayed with the following properties:

- **Name** indicates the unique name of a Report Configuration as specified from the [Configuration - Inventory - Reports](/configuration-inventory-reports) view.
- **Report Template** indicates the [Report Template](/report-templates) in use.
- **Frequencies** indicates the *Report Frequencies* that divide the *Report Period* into equal units.
- **Month From**, **Month To** indicates begin and end of the *Report Period*.

## Creating Reports

Reports can be created from a Report Configuration's 3-dots action menu using the *Run Reports* operation.

Users can select a number of Report Configurations and apply the *Run Reports* bulk operation available from a button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
