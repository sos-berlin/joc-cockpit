# Configuration - Inventory - Workflow - Job Tags

The *Workflow* panel offers designing Workflows from a sequence of instructions. Users can drag & drop the *Job Instruction* from the *Toolbar* to a position in the Workflow.

The GUI offers a number of tabs for specifying Job details. The third tab is offered for *Job Tags*.

## Tags

A Job can be added any number of Tags. They are displayed with the [Workflows](/workflows) view and are optionally included with Notifications. For details see [JS7 - Tagging Jobs](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Tagging+-+Jobs).

- **Tags** allows to add or delete Tags. They can be selected from the list of existing Tags. Typing a Tag name will create the Tag.

## Tag Groups

Tag Groups can be used to organize Tags that should share a common group. For example, a Job should be assigned one of the ticket priorities P1, P2, P3, P4 depending on the Job's criticality. Users can enter the Tag Group and Tag separated by colon as in *TicketPriority:P1*, *TicketPriority:P2* etc. The ticket priority of a Job becomes available when Notifications are created in case of failure and can be used to feed a ticket system.

- **Tag-Group:Tag** allows to add or delete the related Tag in the Tag Group specified. The Tag Group will be created if it does not exist.
