- **History Status** indicates if a transfer was *successful* or *failed*.
  - *Success* indicates that all files in the transfer were successfully processed.
  - *Failed* indicates that one or more files in the transfer were processed with errors.
- **Profile Name** is the unique identifier of a file transfer profile.

### History per File

A file transfer operation can include any number of files. The *File Transfer History* displays the transfer status per file when clicking the arrow-down icon available from the transfer:

Information displayed is grouped in the following blocks:

- **Source** indicates the source of transfer.
- **Target** indicates the target of transfer.
- **Jump** indicates use of a jump host between source and target. A *Jump* host is used if file transfer cannot be directly performed between source and target but requires a host in the DMZ for incoming and outgoing operations.

Details are displayed for *Source*, *Target* and *Jump* hosts:

- **Host** indicates the hostname or IP address of the server.
- **Account** indicates the user account used to access the server.
- **Port** indicates the port used to connect to the server.
- **Protocol** indicates the file transfer protocol such as FTP, FTPS, SFTP, CIFS etc.

For *Source* and *Target* the following details are displayed:

- **File Name** indicates the name of the file.
- **File Path** indicates the path from the file name and any directories.
- **Status**
  - **TRANSFERRED** indicates that the file was successfully transferred when used with *COPY* or *MOVE* operations.
  - **DELETED** indicates that the file was deleted when used with the *REMOVE* operation.
  - **SKIPPED** indicates that the file was excluded from transfer, for example when used with the *GETLIST* operation.
- **Size** specifies the number of bytes transferred.
