# Configuration - Inventory - Notice Boards

The *Notice Boards* panel offers specifying Notice Boards for use with Workflows. For details see [JS7 - Notice Boards](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Notice+Boards).

Notice Boards implement dependencies between Workflows:

- Notice Boards allow adding Notices 
  - from user intervention, see [Resources - Notice Boards](/resources-notice-boards).
  - from the *PostNotices Instruction* in a Workflow, see [JS7 - PostNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+PostNotices+Instruction).
- Workflows can be configured to make Orders expect Notices from the following instructions:
  - *ExpectNotices Instruction* is used to check if Notices are available from one or more Notice Boards that are added by a *PostNotices Instruction* or by the user. If the Notice does not exist, then by default the Order will remain in the *waiting* state with the instruction. A Workflow can include any number of *ExpectNotices Instructions* to expect Notices from the same or from different Notice Boards. For details see [JS7 - ExpectNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ExpectNotices+Instruction).
  - *ConsumeNotices Instruction* is used to make Orders expect one or more Notices from Notice Boards that are added by a *PostNotices Instruction* or by the user. The *ConsumeNotices Instruction* is a block instruction that can include any other instructions and that will delete the Notices that have been expected when an Order reaches the end of the instruction block. For details see [JS7 - ConsumeNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ConsumeNotices+Instruction).

The following flavors are available for Notice Boards:

- **Global Notice Boards** implement Notices at global scope which makes the same Notice available for any Workflow at any time.
- **Schedulable Notice Boards** implement Notices in scope of the [Daily Plan](/daily-plan). A Notice exists in scope of a *Daily Plan* date, for example
  - Workflow 1 runs Mon-Fri.
  - Workflow 2 runs Mon-Sun and depends on previous execution of Workflow 1.
  - During weekends Workflow 1 will not start. To allow Workflow 2 starting on weekends, the dependency is mapped to the Daily Plan by use of *Schedulable Notice Boards*: for days on which no Order is announced for Workflow 1, the dependency is ignored.

Notice Boards are managed from the following panels:

- The [Configuration - Inventory - Navigation Panel](/configuration-inventory-navigation) on the left side of the window offers navigation by folders holding Notice Boards. In addition, the panel offers operations on Notice Boards.
- The *Notice Board Panel* on the right side of the window holds details for Notice Board configuration.

## Notice Board Panel

For a Notice Board the following inputs are available:

- **Name** is the unique identifier of a Notice Board, see [Object Naming Rules](/object-naming-rules).
- **Title** holds an optional explanation of the Notice Board's purpose.
- **Notice Board Type** is one of *Global Notice Board* or *Schedulable Notice Board*

### Global Notice Boards

- **Notice ID for Posting Order** holds a constant value or an expression derived from the posting Order:
  - An empty value can be used and a string can be used specifying a constant value.
  - A Regular Expression can be used:
    - *Matching Daily Plan Date* extracts the Daily Plan date from the Order ID using the expression: *replaceAll($js7OrderId, '^#([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})#.*$', '$1')*
    - *Matching Daily Plan Date and Order Name* extracts the Daily Plan date and Order name from the Order ID using the expression: *replaceAll($js7OrderId, '^#([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})#.*-([^:]*)(?::[^|]*)?([|].*)?$', '$1$2$3')*
    - *Matching Order Name* extracts the Order name using the expression: *replaceAll($js7OrderId, '^#[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}#.*-([^:]*)(?::[^|]*)?([|].*)?$', '$1$2')*
- **Notice ID for Expecting Order** should hold the same expression as the *Notice ID for Posting Order*.

### Schedulable Notice Boards

- **Notice ID for Posting Order** holds a constant value or an expression derived from the posting Order:
  - An empty value can be used and a string can be used specifying a constant value.
  - A Regular Expression can be used:
    - *Matching Order Name* extracts the Order name using the expression: *replaceAll($js7OrderId, '^#[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}#.*-([^:]\*)(?::[^|]*)?([|].*)?$', '$1$2')*

### Operations on Notice Boards

For available operations see [Configuration - Inventory - Navigation Panel](/configuration-inventory-navigation).

## Use with Workflow Instructions

Workflow Instructions for Notice Boards offer the following options:

- **PostNotices Instruction** holds the list of Notice Boards for which Notices are posted. The instruction does not require options.
- **ExpectNotices Instruction**, **ConsumeNotices Instruction** hold the following inputs:
  - **Expression** specifies conditions from one or more Notice Boards that evaluate to *true* or *false*:
    - **&&** as an "and" condition
    - **||** as an "or" condition
    - **()** parantheses specify the precedence by which conditions are evaluated.
    - Notice Board names in expressions must be quoted.
    - Examples:
      - **'NB1' && 'NB2'**: expects Notices from both Notice Boards *NB1* and *NB2* being present to evaluate to *true*.
      - **( 'NB1' && 'NB2' ) || 'NB3'**: expects Notices being present from *NB1* and *NB2*. Alternatively, if a Notice from *NB3* is present, the expression evaluates to *true*.
  - **When not announced** specifies the behavior in case that a Notice was not announced. This applies to days for which no Order is available from a posting Workflow.
    - **Wait** is the default and causes Orders to wait for Notices being present independently from the fact that they have been announced or not.
    - **Skip** causes Orders to skip the instruction if the Notice is not announced.
    - **Process** is available for the *ConsumeNotices Instruction* and makes an Order enter the block instruction in case that the Notice is not announced.
