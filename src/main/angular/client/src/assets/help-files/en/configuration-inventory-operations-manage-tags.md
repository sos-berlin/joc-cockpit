# Configuration - Inventory - Operations - Manage Tags

JS7 offers [JS7 - Tagging](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Tagging) for Workflows, Jobs and Orders.

- Tags are managed from the inventory available with the JOC Cockpit *Configuration* view.
  - Workflows are assigned any number of Tags.
  - Schedules are assigned any number of Tags that are added to Orders created by the [Daily Plan Service](/service-daily-plan).
- Tags can be applied when manually adding ad hoc Orders.
- Tags can be used in the *Workflows* view, *Orders Overview* view, *Daily Plan* view and *History* view for filtering of Workflows and Orders.

## Manage Tags for Workflow

Users can add, update and remove Tags for a single Workflow.

When entering Tags, the list of existing Tags is offered. Other than that, users can type the name of a new Tag. Tag names are case-sensitive.

## Manage Tags for Workflows from Folders

Users can add, update and remove Tags for all Workflows available in the selected folder and in sub-folders recursively.

The *List of Tags* indicates the Tag name and the Workflows that are assigned the Tag. Users can remove the assignment of a Tag.
