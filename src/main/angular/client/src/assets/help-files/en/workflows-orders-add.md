# Adding Orders to Workflows

Orders can be added on demand and will be executed independently from the Daily Plan.

Users who are happy with default values and wish to submit an Order for immediate execution will not have to add any further input. 

### Order Attributes

- **Order Name**: An optional name that can be used to filter Orders in a number of views.
- **Tag Name**: Any number of Tags can be specified that will be added to the Order. Tags are displayed in a number of views if specified from the [Settings - JOC Cockpit](/settings-joc) page.
- **Ignore Job Admission Times**: Jobs can be limited to run on certain days and/or in certain timeslots. Orders arriving outside of a timeslot have to wait for the next available timeslot. The option forces Jobs to start independently from such limitations.

### Start Time

- **Now**: The Order will start immediately.
- **Specific Date**: The Order will start at the specified date and time.
- **Relative to Current Time**: The Order will start with an offset of hours, minutes, seconds from the current time. Examples:
  - **30s**: 30 seconds later
  - **15m**: 15 minutes later
  - **1h**: 1 hour later
  - **1h 15m 30s** or **01:15:30**: 1 hour, 15 minutes and 30 seconds later
- **No Start Time**: The Order will not start but will be available from the *pending* state and can be assigned a start time later on.

### Order Dependencies

- **Notice Space Key**: If the Workflow holds dependencies based on Notices, then a Daily Plan date can be specified to which dependencies will be resolved. By default the current day is used.
  - past dates are accepted for which a plan is opened.
  - future dates are accepted.

### Order Position

If an Order should not start from the first node in the Workflow, then a position can be specified.

- **Block Position**: For Workflows holding block instructions such as Try/Catch, ResourceLock, Fork/Join the related instruction can be selected.
- **Start Position**: If no Start Position is specified, then the Order will start from the first node.
  - If no Block Position is specified, then any top-level instruction in the Workflow can be selected from which the Order will start.
  - If a Block Position is specified, then the Start Position is a same-level node inside the block.
- **End Positions**:
  - If no Block Position is specified, then any top-level instruction in the Workflow can be selected before which the Order will terminate.
  - If a Block Position is specified, then any same-level node inside the block can be specified before which the Order will terminate.
  - More than one End Position can be specified.
- **Priority**:
  - If the Order will meet a Resource Lock instruction in the Workflow that limits parallelism, then its *Priority* determines the position in the queue of *waiting* Orders.
  - *Priorities* are specified from negative, zero and positive integers or from the shortcuts offered. A higher *Priority* has precedence. Shortcuts offer the following values:
    - **Low**: -20000
    - **Below Normal**: -10000
    - **Normal**: 0
    - **Above Normal**: 10000
    - **High**: 20000

### Order Parameterization

- **Assign Parameterization from Schedule**: If the Workflow is assigned a Schedule, then this can be selected to copy its parameterization such as variables and tags to the current Order.
- **Modify Variable**: 
  - If the Workflow specifies variables without default values, then the current Order has to specify related values.
  - If the Workflow specifies variables with default values, then the link allows to select a variable for which a new value should be specified.
- **Modify Variables**: Behaves similarly to *Modify Variable* but displays all available variables.

### Additional Orders

- **Add Order**: If more than one Order should be added to the Workflow, then the link will add the parameterization for the additional Order.
- **Add Orders from Schedules**: if the Workflow is assigned one or more Schedules, then for each Schedule an Order parameterized from a Schedule will be added.
