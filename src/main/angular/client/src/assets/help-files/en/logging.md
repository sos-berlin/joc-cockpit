# Logging

The JOC Cockpit offers logging for GUI operations should the need arise to analyze for example response times of the [REST Web Service API](/rest-api).

Users can specify the desired log levels:

- **Info**
- **Error**
- **Warn**
- **Debug**

To activate logging, the following checkbox should be checked:

- **Log Enabled**

Log output will become available in the *Logging* view. Log settings are persisted and are active for later user sessions too.

## Operations on Log Output

When log output is available, then the following operations can be applied from related buttons in the right upper corner of the view:

- **Copy to clipboard** will copy log output to the user's clipboard.
- **Open in new tab** will open a new browser tab that holds related log output.
