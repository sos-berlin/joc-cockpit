# Configuration - Inventory - Workflows

The *Workflow* panel offers designing Workflows from a sequence of instructions that shape the Workflow for a [Directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). 

- Users can drag & drop instructions from the *Toolbar* to create Workflow patterns such as a sequence of Jobs, forking and joining Jobs, conditional execution etc.
- The [Configuration - Inventory - Navigation Panel](/configuration-inventory-navigation) offers navigation by Tags and folders. In addition, the panel offers operations on Workflows.

## Toolbar Panel

The *Toolbar* holds the following instructions:

- **Job Instruction** implements a Job. Workflows can include any number of Jobs. For details see [JS7 - Job Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Job+Instruction).
- **Try/Catch Instruction** implements exception handling from a *Try* block that holds Jobs or other instructions. If a Job fails, then the instructions in the *Catch* block will be executed. An empty *Catch* block will resolve the error status of a previously failed instruction. For details see [JS7 - Try-Catch Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Try-Catch+Instruction).
- **Retry Instruction** implements repeated execution of a sequence of Jobs or other instructions in case of failure. If one of the Jobs in the *Retry* block fails, then the Order is moved to the begin of the *Retry* block to repeat execution. For details see [JS7 - Retry Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Retry+Instruction).
- **Finish Instruction** makes an Order leave the Workflow with a successful or unsuccessful outcome in the [JS7 - Order History](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Order+History). For details see [JS7 - Finish Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Finish+Instruction).
- **Fail Instruction** makes an Order fail. Without further error handling the Order will remain in the *failed* state, see [Order States](/order-states). A surrounding *Try/Catch Instruction* or *Retry Instruction* is triggered by the *Fail Instruction*. For details see [JS7 - Fail Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Fail+Instruction).
- **Fork Instruction** allows Orders to be forked and joined to enable parallel processing of Jobs and other instructions in a Workflow. Branches are created by dragging & dropping instructions on the *Fork Instruction*. When an Order enters the *Fork Instruction*, then a Child Order is created for each branch. For details see [JS7 - Fork-Join Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Fork-Join+Instruction).
  - Each Child Order will pass the nodes in its branch independently of parallel Child Orders.
  - Child Orders can return results to Parent Orders by passing variables.
  - Child Orders take the role of Parent Orders in nested *Fork Instructions*.
- **ForkList Instruction** is the dynamic version of a *Fork Instruction* and comes in the following flavors:
  - The instruction expects an Order to provide a *List Variable* that is implemented as a list (array) of values. The list can include any number of name/value pairs (variables). The *ForkList Instruction* is designed as a single branch: depending on the number of entries provided with the *List Variable* carried by the Order, the Agent will dynamically create branches for each entry of the *List Variable*. This allows for example executing Jobs for each entry of a *List Variable*. For details see [JS7 - ForkList-Join Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ForkList-Join+Instruction).
  - The instruction allows a number of Child Orders and branches being created dynamically to execute the same sequence of Jobs or other instructions on a number of Subagents: users can run the same Jobs in parallel on a number of servers or containers operating Subagents. Use cases include for example executing similar backup Jobs on a larger number of servers. For details see [JS7 - ForkList-Join Instruction for Agent Clusters](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ForkList-Join+Instruction+for+Agent+Clusters).
- **Cycle Instruction** offers repeated execution of all or some of the Jobs and other instructions in a Workflow. It's a block instruction that can spawn the complete Workflow or selected Jobs and instructions in a Workflow. The *Cycle Instruction* can be nested. For details see [JS7 - Cycle Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Cycle+Instruction).
- **Break Instruction** is used in a *Cycle Instruction* to terminate the cycle and to make an Order leave the cycle. For details see [JS7 - Break Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Break+Instruction).
- **Lock Instruction** is a block instruction that is used to specify one or more Jobs and other instructions for mutual exclusion, to prevent Jobs from being executed in parallel either in the same Workflow or in different Workflows. *Lock Instructions* can be nested. For details see [JS7 - Lock Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Lock+Instruction).
- **Sleep Instruction** is used to delay further processing in a Workflow by a given amount of time. For details see [JS7 - Sleep Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Sleep+Instruction).
- **Prompt Instruction** halts execution of an Order in a Workflow until the prompt is confirmed. The Order is assigned the *prompting* state. Users can confirm or cancel *prompting* orders, see [Order States](/order-states). For details see [JS7 - Prompt Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Prompt+Instruction).
- **AddOrder Instruction** is used in a Workflow to create an Order for a different Workflow. By default added Orders run asynchronously in a separate Workflow and in parallel to the current Order, i.e. their execution result is not synchronized and does not have an impact on the current Order. Should the execution of the added Order be synchronized, then the *ExpectNotices Instruction* and *ConsumeNotices Instruction* can be used. For details see [JS7 - AddOrder Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+AddOrder+Instruction).
- **PostNotices Instruction** is used to create one or more Notices for Notice Boards. The Notices are waited for by the corresponding *ExpectNotices Instruction* and *ConsumeNotices Instruction* from the same or from different Workflows. A Workflow can include any number of *PostNotices Instructions* to post Notices to the same or to different Notice Boards. Posting a Notice will not block further execution of an Order in a Workflow. The Order continues immediately having posted the Notice. For details see [JS7 - PostNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+PostNotices+Instruction).
- **ExpectNotices Instruction** is used to check if Notices are available from one or more Notice Boards that are added by a *PostNotices Instruction* or by the user. If the Notice does not exist, then the Order will remain in the *waiting* state with the instruction. A Workflow can include any number of *ExpectNotices Instructions* to expect Notices from the same or from different Notice Boards. For details see [JS7 - ExpectNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ExpectNotices+Instruction).
- **ConsumeNotices Instruction** is used to make Orders expect Notices from one or more Notice Boards that are added by a *PostNotices Instruction* or by the user. The *ConsumeNotices Instruction* is a block instruction that can include any other instructions and that will delete the Notices that have been expected when an Order reaches the end of the instruction block. For details see [JS7 - ConsumeNotices Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+ConsumeNotices+Instruction).
- **If Instruction** is a block instruction used for conditional processing in a Workflow. It allows to check return codes and return values of previous Jobs and to evaluate Order Variables. For details see [JS7 - If Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+If+Instruction).
- **Case Instruction** is used for conditional processing of Jobs and other instructions in a Workflow. The instruction extends the *If Instruction*. The *Case Instruction* is be used with repeated *Case-When Instructions* and optionally a single *Case-Else Instruction*. For details see [JS7 - Case Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Case+Instruction).
- **CaseWhen Instruction** is used to check a predicate similar to the *If Instruction*. The instruction can occur any number of times in a *Case Instruction*.
- **CaseElse Instruction** is used if all checks from *CaseWhen Instructions* fail.
- **StickySubagent Instruction** can be used to execute a number of Jobs with the same Subagent of an Agent Cluster. The block instruction checks the first available Subagent of a Subagent Cluster. This Subagent will be used for subsequent jobs within the block instruction. Use of Agent Clusters is subject to the terms for clustering with the [JS7 - License](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+License). For details see [JS7 - StickySubagent Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+StickySubagent+Instruction+for+Agent+Clusters).
- **Options Instruction** is a block instruction that rules error handling for the *Lock Instruction* and *ConsumeNotices Instruction*. If the *Options Instruction* is in place and specifies the *Stop on Failure* property then *failed* Orders will remain with the failing instruction, for example a Job. If the instruction is not in place, then Orders that fail within a *Lock Instruction* or *ConsumeNotices Instruction* will be moved to the begin of the instruction block and will remain in the *failed* state. For details see [JS7 - Options Instruction](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Options+Instruction).
- **Paste** offers to drag & drop a previously copied or cut instruction to the Workflow.

## Workflow Panel

The panel holds the graphical representation of a Workflow.

- Users can drag & drop instructions from the *Toolbar Panel* to the Workflow.
  - To drag & drop the first instruction in a Workflow, users hold the mouse key pressed and drop the instruction in the indicated drop area of the Workflow.
  - To drag & drop further instructions, users hold the mouse key pressed, navigate to the desired connector line between instructions and release the mouse key.
- For the *Fork Instruction* users can drag & drop a *Job Instruction* directly on the *Fork* node to create a new branch.
- For the *If Instruction* users can drag & drop a *Job Instruction* directly on the *If* block: the first instruction represents the *true* branch, the second instruction dragged & dropped creates the *false* branch.

Workflows are automatically stored to the inventory. This happens every 30s and when leaving the *Workflow Panel*.

For a Workflow the following inputs are available:

- **Name** is the unique identifier of a Workflow, see [Object Naming Rules](/object-naming-rules).
- **Title** holds an optional explanation of the Workflow's purpose.
- **Job Resources** are inventory objects that hold variables from key/value pairs that can be made available from Workflow Variables and from Environment Variables. *Job Resources* can be assigned at Job level and they can be assigned at Workflow level which makes them available to all Jobs in a Workflow. For details see [Configuration - Inventory - Job Resources](/configuration-inventory-job-resources).
- **Time Zone** that is populated from the user's [Profile - Preferences](/profile-preferences). For input, time zone identifiers are accepted such as *UTC*, *Europe/London* etc. For a full list of time zone identifiers see [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
  - The *Time Zone* is applied to periods in Job Admission Times and in *Cycle Instructions*.
  - It is possible using a *Time Zone* different from the [Settings - Daily Plan](/settings-daily-plan). However, it might cause confusing results.
- **Allow undeclared variables** offers use of Order Variables that are not declared with the Workflow. This includes that Orders can carry variables that are not checked for data type or mandatory use. Jobs will fail when referencing undeclared variables that are not available from an Order.

### Workflow Variables

Workflow Variables are declared from the Workflow and are used to parameterize execution of Jobs:

- Required variables are declared by the Workflow without default value. Orders added to the Workflow have to specify values for required variables.
- Optional variables are declared by the Workflow with a default value. Orders added to the Workflow can specify values and otherwise the default value is used.

For Workflow Variables the following data types are offered:

- **String** holds any characters. Optionally values can be enclosed with single quotes.
  - Constant values: *hello world*
  - Functions: *now( format='yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss', timezone='Europe/London' )*, *env('HOSTNAME')*
- **Number** holds integers and floating numbers such as 3.14.
- **Boolean** values are *true* or *false*.
- **Final** values are evaluated by the Controller when an Order is added. Other data types are evaluated by the Agent when an Order is started.
  - Primary use is about functions such as: *jobResourceVariable( 'myJobResource', 'myVariable' )*
  - For details see [JS7 - Expressions for Variables](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Expressions+for+Variables).
- **List** is an array data type that offers adding any number of variables each using its individual data type and default value.
  - References to array variables use the syntax: *$colors(0).lightblue*, *$colors(0).blue*, *$colors(1).lightgreen*, *$colors(1).green*
- **Map** is a list of variables each using its individual data type and default value.
  - References to map variables use the syntax: *$colors.blue*, *$colors.green*

### Search in Workflows

On top of the *Workflow Panel* a Search Icon is available. Clicking the icon offers specifying a string that matches the name of a Job or Workflow Instruction.

- When typing the first character, a list box is opened that displays matching Workflow Instructions and indicates hits from red color.
- When clicking a hit, then the window scrolls to the related Job or Workflow Instruction.
- Instruction Search is case-insensitive and is left-truncated and right-truncated. For example, typing the character **O** (uppercase o) will find *J**o**b*.

### Operations on Workflows

#### Deployment Operations

On top of the *Workflow Panel* users find the following status indicators:

- **valid** / **not valid** indicates from blue / orange color if the Workflow is consistent and ready for deployment. *Invalid* Workflows cannot be deployed, however, changes are stored to the inventory. For example, a missing Agent assignment to a Job will make the Workflow *invalid*. Inside the *not valid* status indicator the (i) information icon is available that displays the reason why the Workflow is +not valid*
- **deployed** / **not deployed** indicates if the current version of the Workflow has been *deployed* or is a draft that was *not deployed*.

The *Deploy* button offers deployment to a Controller from a single click operation. Other than that, deployment operations are available at folder level, see [Configuration - Inventory - Navigation Panel](/configuration-inventory-navigation).

#### Operations on Instructions

When hovering the mouse on an instruction, then the 3-dots action menu is offered for the following operations:

- **All Instructions** offer the *Copy*, *Cut* and *Remove* operations. Block instructions such as the *Fork Instruction* in addition offer the *Remove All* operation: while *Remove* will remove the instruction only, the *Remove All* operation will remove the instruction and any instructions included such as Jobs.
- **Job Instruction** offers the *Make Job Template* operation that creates a Job Template from the current Job. The Job Template can be used by other Jobs in the same or in different Workflows.

#### Copy, Cut, Paste Operations

**Copy** and **Cut** operations are available from an instruction's 3-dots action menu. The *copy* and *cut* operations on a block instruction act on any instructions included with the block instruction. To copy or cut more than one instruction from the same level, users keep the mouse key pressed and mark the instructions similar to use of a lasso. 

- **Ctrl+C** keyboard shortcut will copy the highlighted instructions.
- **Ctrl+X** keyboard shortcut will cut the highlighted instructions.

**Paste** operations are available from the *Toolbar Panel* that allows dragging & dropping the copied or cut instructions to the Workflow.

- **Ctrl+V** keyboard shortcut will paste the copied or cut instructions when the user clicks a connector line between Workflow instructions.

#### Operations Panel

When clicking the canvas of the *Workflow Panel* an *Operations Panel* will become visible that offers the following operations:

- Zoom Operations
  - **Zoom In** will increase the size of Workflow Instructions.
  - **Zoom Out** will decrease the size of Workflow Instructions.
  - **Zoom to Default** will establish the default size of Workflow Instructions.
  - **Fit to Panel** will choose a size for Workflow Instructions that allows the Workflow to fit to the panel size.
- Undo, Redo Operations
  - **Undo** will revert the latest change. Up to 20 operations can be reverted.
  - **Redo** will replay the latest change that was undone.
- Download, Upload Operations
  - **Download JSON** will download the Workflow in JSON storage format to a .json file.
  - **Upload JSON** offers to upload a .json file that will replace the Workflow.
- Export Operations
  - **Export Image** offers download of a .png image file of the Workflow.
