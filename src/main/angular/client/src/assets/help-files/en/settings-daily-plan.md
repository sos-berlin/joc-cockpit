## Daily Plan Settings

### Setting: *time\_zone*, Default: *UTC*

Specifies the time zone that is applied to the start time of the Daily Plan Service and period of the Daily Plan.

### Setting: *period\_begin*, Default: *00:00*

Specifies the begin of the 24 hours' Daily Plan period with the indicated time zone.

### Setting: *start\_time*, Default: *30 minutes before period\_begin*

Specifies the start time for running the Daily Plan on a daily basis with the indicated time zone. Without this setting the Daily Plan will run 30 minutes before the point in time specified by the *period\_begin* setting. This setting accepts a time value, for example 23:00:00.

### Setting: *days\_ahead\_plan*, Default: *7*

Specifies the number of days ahead for which Orders are generated and are made available with the *planned* status. A *0* value indicates that no Orders should be generated and disables the functionality.

### Setting: *days\_ahead\_submit*, Default: *3*

Specifies the number of days ahead for which *planned* Orders are submitted to Controllers and are made available with the *submitted* state. A *0* value indicates that no Orders should be submitted and disables the functionality.

### Setting: *submit\_orders\_individually*, Default: *false*

The Daily Plan Service by default submits Orders from a single transaction that is rolled back if submission of an Order fails.

### Setting: *age\_of\_plans\_to\_be\_closed\_automatically*, Default: *1*

Specifies the number of days after which the Daily Plan will be closed and will not allow adding Orders that resolve dependencies for [Resources - Notice Boards](/resources-notice-boards) for the original date.
