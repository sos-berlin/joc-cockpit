# Manage Encryption Certificate

The [JS7 - Encryption and Decryption](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Encryption+and+Decryption) offers a secure way of handling secrets used in Jobs. Users can encrypt and decrypt sensitive data such as passwords by use of asymmetric keys.

For details see [Manage Encryption Keys](/encryption-manage-keys).

The *Manage Encryption Certificate* page is used for specifying properties of the Certificate.

## Certificate

The following properties are specified for a Certificate:

- **Certificate Alias** is the unique name that users assign a Certificate. Users are free to choose the name. The Certificate and properties will be stored with a Job Resource using the indicated name.
- **Certificate** allows copying/pasting a Certificate in PEM format. A Certificate can look like this:

- **Path to Private Key file** specifies the location of the Private Key with related Agents.
- **Job Resource Folder** specifies the inventory folder in which the Job Resource holding the Certificate will be stored. A folder hierarchy can be specified using forward slashes as in /a/b/c. Non-existing folders will be created.

## Operations on Certificate

The following operations are available from links:

- **Use of Certificate by Agents** displays the *Agent Name* and URL of Agents assigned the Certificate. 
- **Assign Certificate to Agents** offers selecting Standalone Agents and Cluster Agents that are assigned the Certificate. Users have to take care that the related Agent holds the Private Key file in the location specified with the *Path to Private Key file* property. Users can select Agents that know the Private Key.
- **Encryption Test** allows to perform a test encryption:
  - Clicking the link opens the *Plain Text* input field to which a string such as *secret* can be added.
  - Right to the input field the encryption icon is offered. Clicking the icon displays the *Encryption Result* label with the related result.
