For details see [JS7 - Inventory Favorites](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Inventory+Favorites) and [JS7 - Profiles - Favorite Management](https://kb.sos-berlin.com/display/JS7/JS7+-+Profiles+-+Favorite+Management).

## Favorite Agents

Users might find a larger number of Agents in their scheduling environment from [Standalone Agents](/initial-operation-register-agent-standalone) and from [Subagent Clusters](/initial-operation-register-agent-subagent-cluster). Instead of scrolling through lengthy lists, users can specify their *Favorite Agents* that will make it on top of the list of assignable Agents.

### Adding Favorite Agents

*Favorite Agents* can be added directly when assigning Agents in the [Configuration - Inventory - Workflows - Job Properties](/configuration-inventory-workflow-job-properties) tab. Clicking the \* link for an Agent will add the related Agent to the list of favorites.

Users can add *Favorite Agents* from their *Profile* using the *Add Favorite* button. This allows selecting the Agent that should be added.

### List of Favorite Agents

The list of *Favorite Agents* can be limited from the *Shared with me* button. This restricts the list to favorites shared by other users.

Users can further limit the list by specifying a string for the *Search* input field that will be looked up in the Agent's name. Search implies left and right truncation.

Users can order the list by moving a *Favorite Agent* to an earlier or later position.

### Operations on Favorite Agents

The following operations are available from a *Favorite Agent's* 3-dots action menu:

- **Edit** allows to switch the Agent.
- **Share** offers to share the favorite with other users. Shared favorites are indicated by a related icon.
- **Delete** removes the related Agent from the list of favorites.

## Favorite Facets

Users might hold a larger number of *Facets* in their inventory that are applied to [Configuration - Inventory - Workflows](/configuration-inventory-workflows). If a Workflow specifies Workflow Variables of the string data type, then a *Facet* can be applied to restrict user input. *Facets* are regular expressions that are applied to check matching user input.

When assigning *Facets* to Workflow Variables, instead of scrolling through lengthy lists, users can specify their *Favorite Facets* that will make it on top of the list.

### Adding Favorite Facets

*Favorite Facets* can be added directly when specifying Workflow Variables in the [Configuration - Inventory - Workflows](/configuration-inventory-workflows) view. Clicking the \* link for a *Facet* will add the related *Facet* to the list of favorites.

Users can add *Favorite Facets* from their *Profile* using the *Add Favorite* button. This allows specifying the *Facet* name and related regular expression that should be added.
