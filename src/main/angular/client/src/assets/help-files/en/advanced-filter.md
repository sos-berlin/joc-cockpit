# Advanced Filter

Advanced Filters offer limiting search results in a number of views.

## Customization

- Users can specify the name of a Customization to which the filter will be stored for later reuse.
- Customizations are available in most views and can be activated from a drop-down button below the main menu.

## Search Criteria

Search criteria are additive and will add entries to results that match all criteria specified.

Search from input fields is performed case-insensitive and partially qualified, for example

- searching **rest** will find objects with the name "pdfNon**Rest**artable" and "**REST**-RunningTaskLog"
- searching **re?t** will find objects with the name "ActivePassiveDi**rect**or" and "JITL-JS7**REST**ClientJob"
- searching **re\*t** will find objects with the name "pdSQLExecuto**rExt**ractJSON" and "pdu**Reset**Subagent"
