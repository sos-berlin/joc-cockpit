# Monitor - Controller Availability

The view displays indicators for availability of a Controller.

If a Controller Cluster is used then cluster availability is considered. For example, if a Controller instance in a cluster is shutdown for maintenance purposes and the remaining instance picks up the load, then this does not reduce availability.

The upper right corner of the screen offers the *Current Controller* checkbox: when unchecked availability will be displayed for all connected Controllers and otherwise the information is displayed for the currently selected Controller only.

Users should be aware that historic data for Controller availability are subject to purge by the [Cleanup Service](/service-cleanup).

## Date Filters

The right upper corner of the panel offers selecting a date range for display of availability:

- **Week** makes the date slider switch for a week's period.
- **Month** makes the date slider switch for a month's period.
- **Range** offers specifying the start date and end date.

## Running Time
