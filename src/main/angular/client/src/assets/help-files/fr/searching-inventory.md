# Advanced Search Help

Welcome to the **Advanced Search** feature! This guide will help you master all the search capabilities.

## Getting Started

The Advanced Search allows you to find exactly what you're looking for using *powerful filters* and **search operators**.

### Basic Search Tips

Here are some essential tips to get you started:

- Use **quotes** for exact phrase matching: `"user management"`
- Use the **asterisk** (*) as a wildcard: `manag*` finds "manage", "management", "manager"
- Use **minus sign** (-) to exclude terms: `coffee -decaf`

### Search Operators

You can use these operators to refine your search:

1. **AND**: Both terms must be present
2. **OR**: Either term can be present
3. **NOT**: Exclude specific terms
4. **NEAR**: Terms must be close to each other
